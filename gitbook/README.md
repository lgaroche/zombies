# The TZombies Tutorial

Welcome to the **TZombies Tutorial**, a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on building the TZombies NFT dApp on Tezos.

The **TZombies** dApp is an NFT collection of scary brains and zombies. Collectors are invited to connect their Tezos wallet to the web app and mint one or more NFTs. Some of these NFTs are free, and others cost 2 êœ©. The app also features a marketplace where collectors can openly trade their brains and zombies.

You will learn how to create a modern and user-friendly dApp from scratch. The tutorial covers smart contract development and to front-end implementation.

The application front end will be written with the [React](https://react.dev/) library and the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) development framework.The Smart Contract will be written in the [Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/) language, with support from the [Completium](https://github.com/completium) suite of development tools.

The final application is deployed on the Ghostnet testnet at[ https://zombies-pi.vercel.app](https://zombies-pi.vercel.app), and the [repository](https://github.com/lgaroche/zombies) can be found on GitHub.
