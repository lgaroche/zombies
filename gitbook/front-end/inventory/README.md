# Inventory

The inventory page displays your tez balance and the tokens you own. It will be empty if no wallet is connected.&#x20;

On each of your tokens, there are two actions:&#x20;

* Sell
* Transfer

For these actions, we'll define popups (Material-UI Dialogs) with a form to input the sale or transfer details.

See the next pages for these dialogs.&#x20;
