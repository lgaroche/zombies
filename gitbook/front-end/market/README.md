# Market

The market page displays

* The approval status (is the marketplace contract an approved operator on the connected user's tokens?)
* A button to approve or revoke marketplace permissions
* Active listings of tokens for sale
  * On the ones that have been created by the user, show a `Cancel` button
  * On the others, show a `Buy` button

As for the inventory page, we'll gave a dialog, to confirm the amount a user wants to buy.&#x20;

See the next page for the dialog details.
