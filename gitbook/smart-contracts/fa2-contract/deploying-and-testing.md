# Deploying and testing

## Deployment

Now that we have the contract code ready, let's deploy it in our sandbox.

All contracts on the the Tezos blockchain are deployed in the [Michelson](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/michelson.html). Our Archetype contract needs to be compiled to Michelson and then be deployed to the network. `completium-cli` can do both Michelson generation and deployment.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Michelson code can also be deployed with [octez-client](https://tezos.gitlab.io/oxford/cli-commands.html), and using scripts with Taquito, Completium, and others. We'll first see how to deploy with `completium-cli` to easily validate our contract, and in [the next sections](../better-testing.md), we'll use a more advanced deployment and test setup.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Make sure you are on a `sandbox` endpoint, and run the `deploy` command. We'll need to deploy the permits contract first, it takes the owner as a parameter (we'll use the alice account)

```bash
ccli switch endpoint # select a sandbox endpoint, e.g "sandbox http://localhost:20000"
ccli switch account # select alice (tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb)
ccli deploy ./contracts/permits.arl --parameters '{"owner": "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb"}'
```

You will see the origination output, and find the originated contract address in something like this:&#x20;

```
Origination completed for KT1EYVjiiX2HSjqqgqEryqjCCeTpC7rKRMFo named permits.
```

This means that our permits contract has the address `KT1EYVjiiX2HSjqqgqEryqjCCeTpC7rKRMFo`.

Let's use this to deploy our tzombies fa2 contract (make sure to replace the permits address with the one you deployed):&#x20;

```
ccli deploy ./contracts/tzombies.arl --parameters '{"owner": "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb", "permits": "KT1EYVjiiX2HSjqqgqEryqjCCeTpC7rKRMFo"}'
```

You will get the origination output similar to this:&#x20;

```
Origination completed for KT1CPHS16kLFHFi5AXNhoYjD67nwsEFr6h7o named tzombies.
```

Now we have `KT1CPHS16kLFHFi5AXNhoYjD67nwsEFr6h7o` as our tzombies fa2 contract.&#x20;

## Testing

We can keep using the command line to register tokens and test some minting.&#x20;

The FA2 contract has a `set_token_metadata` entrypoint. This adds metadata to a given token id. We consider it's like "registering" a token on our contract. We can call our entrypoint with the following command (we'll get into the meaning of these parameters [later](../token-metadata.md#contract-encoding)).

```
ccli call tzombies --entry set_token_metadata --arg '{"tid": 1, "tdata": [{"key": "", "value": "0x697066733a2f2f516d53445733794257756e7977624c544c78723835784843464d6d747a5372365a55565138433375346161314d65"}]}'
```

The `call` function on completium-cli is used to send a transaction that calls an entrypoint on our contract. Here we registered token id (`tid`) 1, with some metadata.&#x20;

The command outputs an operation hash (`Operation injected: o...`), this is the unique identifier of your transaction. It allows you to check the receipt, see if has been applied correctly to the chain, and even see the state changes that happened. For this, we'll use `octez-client` (replace the URL with your sandbox RPC URL)&#x20;

```
octez-client -E http://localhost:20000 get receipt for <operation_hash>
```

We can now test the mint entrypoint:

```
ccli call tzombies --entry mint --arg '{"tow": "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb", "tid": 1, "nbt": 1}' --amount 2tz
```

As you can see, the call is pretty straightforward. `tid` is the token id we just declared, `tow` is the recipient address (here Alice again) and `nbt` is the amount of tokens we want to mint. Note that since it's token id 1, we need to send 2êœ© with the transaction, with the parameter `--amount`.

We will cover a more efficient way of deploying and testing our contracts in the [Better Testing](../better-testing.md) section.
