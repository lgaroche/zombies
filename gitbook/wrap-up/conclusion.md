# Conclusion

We now have a functional NFT drop and marketplace dapp on Tezos. It showcases the development and deployment of smart contracts, minting and trading of NFTs, using different methods of payment.&#x20;

We have seen how to test it on a mockup chain, deploy it on a local test network, and deploy it on the Ghostnet environment (see the [Wert integration page](../front-end/drops/buy-with-credit-card.md)).

Deploying to the mainnet is very similar to deploying to Ghostnet. It is recommended to maintain a test version of your dapp on the Ghostnet to validate new features and test Tezos protocol upgrades before they are applied to the mainnet.&#x20;

For any issue with following the tutorial, you can always refer to the repository. Feel free to open issues on Github if you encounter blocking any issue.&#x20;
